          <li><p><span>161 </span> - Aurelius Antoninus' death allows Marcus to rise to power and become Emperor of Rome, along with his brother and co-ruler, Lucius Aurelius Verus Augustus.</p></li>
          <li><p><span>162 </span> - War with the Parthian Empire erupts, lasting through much of the 160s. The war effort was mostly oversaw by his brother Verus, much of their success being accredited to the generals working under him, especially Avidius Cassius. </p></li>
